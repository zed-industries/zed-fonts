# Zed Fonts

* Zed Plex Mono is a fork of IBM Plex with ligatures manually added. It is stored in the `zed-plex` folder.

# Previous Zed Fonts

We used to use Zed Mono and Zed Sans, custom builds of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) liscensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

They were built for use in [Zed](https://zed.dev/). **Zed Sans** uses a quasi-proportional spacing to allow the font to still feel monospace while not having such wide gaps in a UI setting.

## Zed Mono, Zed Sans

**Zed Mono** & **Zed Sans** are custom builds of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).
