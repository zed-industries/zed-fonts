# Zed Fonts

Welcome to Zed Fonts! This project creates special versions of the Iosevka font, tailored for the best experience in the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/).
**Zed Mono** & **Zed Sans** are custom builds of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).
See: [./zed-iosevka](./zed-iosevka)

## Our Fonts

We offer two main font families:

* **Zed Mono**: A custom-built monospace font based on Iosevka, designed for clarity and comfort during long coding sessions.
* **Zed Sans**: Also based on Iosevka, Zed Sans uses a special "quasi-proportional" spacing. This means it generally looks like a monospace font (where all characters take up the same width), which is great for code, but it subtly adjusts spacing to make text in user interfaces look more natural and less gappy.

Both Zed Mono and Zed Sans are designed to be highly readable and pleasant for all your development tasks within Zed.

## Features
* **Based on Iosevka**: Leverages the extensive character set and design principles of the popular Iosevka font family.
* **Optimized for Zed**: Fine-tuned for the Zed editor environment.
* **Clear and Legible**: Designed for maximum readability of code.
* **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and share.
